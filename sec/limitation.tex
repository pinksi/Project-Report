\section{LIMITATIONS}
In this project, the prediction of stock market trends and stock market index is done using various artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. The maximum accuracy obtained falls within acceptable range, still, there are a few limitations of this project which are summarized below:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Effects of stock dividend in future price of a company:} When a company announces a stock dividend, its stock price tends to decrease by certain amount right after the dividend interval is closed. That effect is not accounted in the prediction model. 
	\item \textbf{Effect of seasonal increase/decrease:} The stock prices tend to increase/decrease in certain months of the year. These seasonal characteristics are not incorporated in the prediction model.
	\item \textbf{Sector wise analysis:} The companies trading in stock market belong to different sectors like: banks, finances, insurance companies etc. While predicting prices of a company, the values of the sector it belongs to also plays a vital role. Since, the sector-wise data are available only in small number, its effects could not be studied while building our prediction model. 
\end{enumerate}
