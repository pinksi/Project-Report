\section{CONCLUSION}
In a nutshell, this project predicts the stock movements using various artificial intelligence and datamining techniques. In the project, the market is analyzed based on technical and fundamental factors to obtain short term and long term prediction, respectively. News-sentimental factors are analyzed to predict the NEPSE index trend. The stock trends are then shown graphically for visual representation. The predictions were made using various algorithms and models and the results were compared to each other. The project achieved 92\% accuracy using artificial neural network considering five input factors- opening price, closing price, high price, number of traded shares, and traded volumes. 

As future enhancement, the following points will be considered:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Incorporate the effects of seasonal increase/decrease of stock market 
	\item Incorporate the factors concerning sector-wise analysis in prediction model
	\item Strengthen the prediction model to incorporate the effects of share dividend (like bonus, right share and cash dividend) on the future of the company stock.
	\item Strengthen the fundamental analysis model to predict actual trends over specific and long period (e.g. 30\% rise in stock price of XYZ company in 6 months is predicted) 
	\item Improve visualization systems to make it more interactive and easy to use. 

\end{enumerate}
