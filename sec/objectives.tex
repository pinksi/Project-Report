\section{OBJECTIVES}

The primary goal of this project is to develop a system that takes movie reviews
from users, analyzes them using sophisticated natural language processing and
machine learning algorithms, and then recommend new movies to them that they may
like. To complete this project, we need to research about the state-of-the-art
technologies in the field of natural language processing, sentiment analysis,
machine learning using neural networks, and data mining. So, the objectives of
this project can be divided into two categories.

\subsection{Academic Objectives}

Since this project is an academic project that involves a lot of research on hot
topics like sentiment analysis and natural language processing, the academic
objectives of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item To fulfill the requirements of the partial fulfillment of the Bachelor's
    degree in Computer Engineering, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan
    University;
  \item To research about latest advancements in the field of natural language
    processing, deep learning, sentiment analysis, recommendation system;
  \item To contribute in the active research on natural language processing and
    sentiment analysis;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Objectives}

As already mentioned, the main objective of this project is to build a
sophisticated review database and recommendation system to suggest proper movies
to the users. The main problem we are trying to solve is eliminate the need for
user to give explicit rating for the recommendation system to work properly.
Therefore, the concrete functional objectives of this project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item To create a movie review database application where users can search
    movies, write reviews, as well as read others' reviews;
  \item To create a user-friendly web application for the end-users of our
    system;
  \item To implement a deep learning algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the
    reviews
  \item To develop a recommendation system that suggest users possible
    interesting movies to users based on the movie reviews;
\end{itemize}
